                                        <p>Mark Twain is famously believed to have said, “Revenue is Vanity; Profit is Sanity”, more than a century ago! This (almost) seems to settle a Very familiar, cut & dry business conundrum- ‘Revenue Leadership or Profit Leadership’.</p>
                                        <p>But as the saying goes, every rule has got an exception. So is for this. Though no one can dispute the importance and necessity of profit drive, businesses cannot ignore revenue and earnings growth.</p>
                                        <p>Profitable revenue growth, best of both worlds, would be the ideal scenario for any company to find itself in. But alas, not all, and definitely not all the time companies find itself in this idealistic situation.</p>
                                        <p>According to Harvard Study, in the long term only about 30% (of the global 1000 companies) achieved both positive profitability and real revenue growth in the same year, but couldn’t sustain for 3 years-more often they failed to do so!</p>

                                        <p>In nutshell, let us understand the fine distinction between Profit drive v/s Revenue drive</p>
                                        <p>Profit drive is more about doing it with less. The amount of money left over after the business has paid all costs associated with operating the business. </p>
                                        <p>Revenue drive is about doing more. Total amount of money received from the sale of goods and services before any expenses are deducted. Revenue leadership comes with near term costs which eat into the company’s long-term profitability.</p>
